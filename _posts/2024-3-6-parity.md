title: Parity to increase backup reliability
---

Backups can consist of more than just duplicates of files. Extra information, parity, can be added to enable data recovery in the event of corruption, and in some cases, deletion of data.

Parity became widely used when files began to be shared through Usenet. Transfer speeds were low and connection interruptions common. It was frustrating for the user to have a hours-long download fail because of a transfer error, so parity helped to correct errors as they occurred during the transfer.

Now, data is vulnerable to corruption in different ways depending on the storage medium:

**Optical media** - bit rot occurs as the organic compound used in manufacture literally begins to rot  
**SSD** - data can start to become corrupted in a matter of weeks if the drives are left without power  
**HDD** - physical damage to the moving parts can render the disk unreadable

Parity is widely used, although it is invisible to most users. It exists at the hardware level (server ram) and at the software level (RAID). It can be utilized by the home user to help increase backup reliability.

At its most basic, parity involves adding an extra 'bit' to a string of bits (1s and 0s) to give information about how many of those bits should be a 1, and how many should be zero.

`0011`	Here there are an even number of 1s. We could add a partity bit of 0 to the end and the computer would know that, in whatever order, there should be an even number of 1s in this group. If it recieved `10110` an odd number, it would know that something was wrong and it could request that string to be re-transmitted.

Of course, it quickly becomes more complex that this, but it is not required to have a indepth knowledge of the theory in order to use it. It is enough to know that parity can be used to detect errors, and also to recreate missing data.

The small application **Multipar** is excellent for adding parity to files and archives. It contains a lot of features but the only area which is of concern for basic operation is the redundancy slider as highlighted in the screenshot:

This percantage relates to the amount of the file that can be corrupt and still recoverable, in this case 23%. It is also an indication of the size of the parity file in relation to the original, it will be around 23% of the total size. Depending on your space limitations, you can adjust this accordingly. Even a low amount has the potential to recover a corrupted file however.

The completely hands-off approach is to use **Winrar**, which comes with error-correcting options. When creating an archive, set compression to 'store' which simply bundles all the files up without any compression at all. You can apply compression if you want but if it is not necessary then it is faster to disable it. In archiving options, check 'add recovery record', then in the Advanced tab, set the recovery record percentage.

In both cases, you will need the same software to repair any damaged archives, so it is a good idea to include a copy along with the data being backed-up.

Consider using parity as part of your overall backup scheme. The option within Multipar to automatically fill remaining space in a storage medium such as a Blu-Ray Disc is an excellent way to increase reliability at no real cost.
